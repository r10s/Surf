# Surf

The *Let's Surf* game from ``edge://surf`` ported to WebXDC

The game is created by Microsoft â€“ please see the **Credits** in the game menu for more information. The files in this repo are from Microsoft Edge; however, some of them have been modified so the game can function independently from Edge and use the features of WebXDC.
